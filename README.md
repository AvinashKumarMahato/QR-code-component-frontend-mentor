## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to create a responsive QR code component using HTML and CSS. I practiced layout techniques with Flexbox and implemented custom styles for a clean and modern design.

```html
<div class="container">
    <div class="card">
      <img src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR Code">
      <div class="text">
        <h2>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h2>
        <p>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
      </div>
